### üöÄPower BI Project #3: Waste Management Dashboard ‚Äî Union Councils of Peshawar

## Overview

This project combines **GIS spatial analysis** and **Power BI** to visualize and analyze waste generation across Peshawar‚Äôs Union Councils (UCs). It helps identify high-waste areas, inefficient UCs, and optimizes waste collection routes.

## GIS Analysis

* **Choropleth Map:** Visualizes waste generation per UC (green = low, red = high).
* **Waste per Capita & Vehicle:** Identifies inefficient UCs.
* **Hotspot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*):** Detects clusters of high or low waste.
* **Route Optimization:** Generates 5‚Äì15 min collection and dumping coverage areas for efficient waste management.
* **Outputs:** CSVs for Power BI, PNGs, shapefiles, and GeoJSON polygons.
